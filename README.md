# Local Development Instructions

To start and deploy the bot locally the following steps are required:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create the following files:

```
.env
.env.debug
```

The `.env.debug` file is only parsed when you set an environment variable `DEBUG`. If it is not present it will revert to `.env`

Contents required for the `.env` or `.env.debug` file:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_SUBER_SECRET_DISCORD_TOKEN
```

If you want to make use of the reddit commands you also need to register an App/Bot on reddit.com and add the following lines to the .env files:

```
REDDIT_APP_ID=YOU_APP_ID
REDDIT_APP_SECRET=SUPER_SECRET_REDDIT_APP_SECRET
```

If you want to use nodemon to automatically restart the bot while developing create a nodemon config as well:

```
# ./nodemon.json:
{
  "env": {
    "DEBUG": "true"
  }
}

```

otherwise you can call the bot via:

```
export DEBUG=True python main.py
```

**_Note: export is required when you want to create the environment variable for the current shell AND all processes started from the current shell!_**

# Note

- The code is always up to date with the latest episode on the Youtube Channel
- No PR
- There will be more to come, once the tutorial series has finished!! So do come back and stay up to date

```
